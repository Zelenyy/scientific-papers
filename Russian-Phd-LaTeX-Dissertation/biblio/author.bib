abstract={It is important for national security to control the movement of dangerous or strategically cargo such as explosives, radioactive materials, rare and precious metals. This control can be provided by scanning transport containers by gamma rays. In this report the existing technique for scanning (dual energy method) is considered and the alternative method based on measuring the energy distribution of gamma rays is proposed. For estimation perspectives of the proposing method, the corresponding simulation was conducted by using the GEANT4 toolkit. The example of the algorithm of reconstruction the chemical composition of the scanned object is also considered. In addition the experiment for estimation energy resolution of the detector based on a scintillation crystal BGO and SiPM was carried out.},

	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a laboratory prototype of a solar energetic particle (SEP) detector which will operate along with other space-based instruments to give us more insight into the SEP physics. The instrument is designed to detect protons and electrons with kinetic energies from 10 to 100 MeV and from 1 to 10 MeV respectively. The detector is based on a scintillation cylinder divided into separated disks to get more information about detected particles. Scintillation light from isolated segments is collected by optical fibers and registered with silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM). The work contains the result of laboratory testing of the detector prototype. The detector channels were calibrated, energy resolution for every channel was obtained. Moreover, we present an advanced integral data acquisition and analysis technique based on Bayesian statistics, which will allow operation even during SEP events with very large fluxes. The work is motivated by the need for better measurement tools to study acceleration and transport of SEP in the heliosphere as well as by the need for the monitoring tool to mitigate radiation hazard for equipment and people in space.}

Among other things, there are a lot of various simulations of the dynamics of electron avalanches. This article was written mostly in response to the article The critical avalanche of runaway electrons by Evgeny Oreshkin (EPL, 124 (2018) 15001) which shows rather large numbers for an estimate of the number of runaway electrons. The results of our own simulation and comparison with other papers are presented.}
