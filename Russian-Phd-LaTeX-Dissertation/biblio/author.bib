abstract={The project of the compact space detector for measuring proton (10-100 MeV) and electron (to 10 MeV) energy spectra in solar cosmic rays is presented. The detector can operate in two modes: differential (each event is reconstructed) and integral (only energy spectrum and radiation composition are reconstructed at a high loading).},

abstract={It is important for national security to control the movement of dangerous or strategically cargo such as explosives, radioactive materials, rare and precious metals. This control can be provided by scanning transport containers by gamma rays. In this report the existing technique for scanning (dual energy method) is considered and the alternative method based on measuring the energy distribution of gamma rays is proposed. For estimation perspectives of the proposing method, the corresponding simulation was conducted by using the GEANT4 toolkit. The example of the algorithm of reconstruction the chemical composition of the scanned object is also considered. In addition the experiment for estimation energy resolution of the detector based on a scintillation crystal BGO and SiPM was carried out.},
